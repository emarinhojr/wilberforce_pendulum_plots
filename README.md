# wilberforce_pendulum_plots
This is a simple Jupyter Notebook with a python code to read and plot the data of vertical and rotational moviment of a Wilberfoce pendulum. Based on nonlinear least squares as implemented in curve_fit of scipy module, we get the fitting parameters for each curves. At the end, we implement a plot with both curves to verify the coupling of the oscillations.
