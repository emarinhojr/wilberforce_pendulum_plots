# wilberforce_pendulum_plots
This is a simple Jupyter Notebook with a python code to read and plot the data of vertical and rotational movement of a Wilberforce pendulum. Based on nonlinear least squares as implemented in the curve_fit of scipy module, we get the fitting parameters for each curve. In the end, we implement a plot with both curves to verify the coupling of the oscillations.
